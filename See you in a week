I believe that the direction of the group has grown hostile and I am certain that leaving or at least being gone from the group for a little bit should be the right
choice. I felt that taking this direction is the right move because this is my only way of fighting against the madness that has embedded within the group. Even people 
that are peaceful are now becoming the sources of chaos, even if right or wrong. I thought that most of this would end as quickly as it started and
blow pass like a fever dream but I am afraid for what might happen next. With gaslighting starting off as trolling for a day turned to hostility well over a week 
I believe has reflected of what the group has turned into. I apologize for any words or comments that had a hand or the cause of unnessary arguements that
might have left bad taste or discomfort with hanging out with each other, before last weekend or even now. I feel that I am to blame for most gaslighting or unstability
that I have caused, again I apologize. I plan to just take some time to focus on myself, I just hope that my absence can benefit something towards something more better
for my friends. I wish that things could have been simple as of before but I am afraid that may never happen. I will still be in the group chats to see if anything has 
improved, so far it seems okay but I want to stay in the background for at least the week, maybe towards the end of the school year. I also still will talk to some of you
guys if need be but I won't be there for the most part. Well hope to speak to you guys again in a week.
